<h1 id="zoning-out">Zoning Out Randomizer</h1>
<p>Zoning Out is a city building game for 1 or more players by Spencer Cappallo.
This randomizer will choose the random rules for you and provides a scoresheet.  
For your convenience, the official rules are included.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Rules</summary>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 trios in each of five colors (red, green, blue, yellow,
black)</li>
<li>One bag (three bags is better, and bowls work well as an
alternative)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Place the pyramids in the bag. If using multiple bags, sort the
pyramids by size and place each size in its own bag. Choose three
special scoring rules to play with for the duration of this game. You
may draw them out of a hat randomly, or perhaps select three you’d like
to try. You are now ready to play.</p>
<h2 id="game-idea">Game Idea</h2>
<p>During the game, you will be drawing random pyramids and adding them
to your city’s grid. Pyramids represent different municipal building
zones. Red is Residential (“redsidential”), Yellow is Industrial
(“industriyellow”), Blue is Commercial (“bluemercial”), and Green is
Parks (“green space”). Black pyramids represent certain necessary, but
perhaps unpleasant to be next to, facilities such as wastewater
treatment plants and city dumps.</p>
<p>Large pyramids are large developments, and smaller ones are smaller.
You will be building out your city subject to certain constraints.
Generally, you want colors to be grouped together with the exception of
the black pieces, which you usually want touching as few pieces as
possible. Depending on which scoring rules you’re playing with, these
rules of thumb can vary, however.</p>
<p>The scoring rules you choose will have <strong>target scores</strong>
written on them. The sum of all three target scores will determine the
score you need to win.</p>
<h2 id="game-play">Game Play</h2>
<p>Every turn you will: - Choose which size of pyramid to place - Draw a
random pyramid of that size (by feel if using a single bag) - Place that
pyramid next to a pyramid that’s already been placed – except for your
first turn, where there will of course be no other pyramids in play. -
<strong>IMPORTANT: You may NEVER place a pyramid next to another pyramid
of the same size</strong> - <strong>IMPORTANT: Diagonals do not exist in
Zoning Out.</strong> You may never place diagonally, and all scoring
rules ignore diagonals. - In the unlikely event that you are unable to
place the piece you drew due to there being no legal, valid placements,
return that piece and draw a piece of a different size.</p>
<p>When you have placed all your pyramids, proceed to scoring your new
city.</p>
<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<p>Scoring is as follows: - Find your largest connected group (remember:
no diagonals) in each of red, blue, green, and yellow. Each of these
groups scores 1 point for every pyramid within it. - Now score your
black pyramids. Black pyramids score negatively. They subtract a value
equal to their (size) x (the number of pyramids next to them). So, a
3-pip (large) black pyramid with two other pyramids next to it (of any
color), would score -(3*2) = -6 points - Next, score your three <a
href="#special-scoring-rules">special scoring rules</a>. These scoring
rules will have the details of how they score written on them. -
Finally, tally up your score. If your score is equal to or higher than
the sum of the target scores on all three scoring rules, you win. If
it’s lower, you’ve lost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scoring Example</strong> In this example game (played using
fewer than normal pyramids for illustrative purposes), we would score
first the largest groups in each of the four colors: Red = 4, Yellow =
3, Green = 6, and Blue = 2. This would give us 15 points. Then we
subtract all the points from black pieces: -2 + -1 + -6 + -6 + -2 + -6 =
-23. We get a basic score of -8! Note that two black pieces next to each
other both still count against their tallies. After calculating this
base score, we would then score the special scoring rules selected for
our game. <img src="images/basic_scoring.svg" width="500"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a <a href="#scoring-sheet">scoring sheet</a> at the end of
this document that you can use for calculating your score.</p>
<h2 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h2>
<p>Though designed as a single player experience, there are a couple
ways to play Zoning Out with more than one player.</p>
<h3 id="co-operative">Co-operative</h3>
<p>Play exactly as described above, but take turns drawing and placing
pieces.</p>
<h3 id="competitive">Competitive</h3>
<p>You will need additional equipment for this mode. You will need
player screens (something to hide each player’s city), and you will need
additional pyramids: at least 2 trios in the five colors per player. You
can have some players use other colors (for example, the “xeno” colors)
so long as all players agree on which color correlates to which.</p>
<p>To setup, draw special scoring cards as normal. These will apply to
all players, but you will ignore the target score values. Each player
should set up all their pieces in a place near to them as a supply. On
their turn, a player <strong>chooses</strong> which piece they wish to
play next. All players must then add that same piece type to their city
(behind their screen).</p>
<p>Play continues this way until all pieces have been placed. Players
score their own city following the usual scoring procedure. Whichever
player has the highest valued city is the winner.</p>

	<summary>Variants</summary>
	<h2 id="variants">Variants</h2>
	<h3 id="apc-analysis-paralysis-commission">APC: Analysis Paralysis
Commission</h3>
<p>Instead of drawing pieces randomly, shuffle the three sizes
separately and lay them out into three lines, one line for each size of
piece. During play, you can take the front piece from any line. Warning:
playing like this can turn the game into a <em>very</em> think-y puzzle.
It can also make the game easier to win, so if you find you are winning
too often, you can up the challenge by increasing the target score by a
few points whenever you play.</p>
<h3 id="small-city">Small City</h3>
<p>This variant is good for a quicker, more relaxed game. Play with only
2 trios per color, and with only 2 special scoring rules.</p>
<h2 id="special-scoring-rules">Special Scoring Rules</h2>
<p>During your game you will be playing with three of the special
scoring rules listed below. For the solo and co-operative game modes, a
target score is listed. Your goal is to build a city that scores as much
or more than the target scores of all three special scoring rules added
together. For convenience, the titles of the rules are also listed in
here with links to the rules themselves. To randomly select scoring
rules, you could write these titles on slips of paper and draw three
from a hat.</p>

<p>For this game, you may place a second piece on top of an existing
piece when placing. For the purposes of all other rules, these two
pieces are considered next to each other (so you may never, for example,
place a medium on top of another medium). Both pieces are also
considered next to the four spaces orthogonal to their space. For
legibility, you should arrange the pieces such that the smaller piece is
stacked on top of the larger piece.</p>
